Elephriend Zone - Development Log
================================

This log documents the step-by-step creation and iteration of the "Elephriend Zone" game project.

---

1. **Project Initialization**
   - Set up a lightweight browser game using HTML5 Canvas and vanilla JavaScript for low bandwidth and slow computer compatibility.
   - Created `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `game.js` with a simple UI and game loop.

2. **Initial Game Mechanics**
   - Elephants spawn at the edges and move toward randomly placed farms.
   - Player can place deterrents (beehive, chili, solar light) to repel elephants.
   - Game over if an elephant reaches a farm.

3. **UI and Controls**
   - Added deterrent selection buttons and mouse-based placement.
   - Added resource and score display.

4. **Gameplay Adjustments**
   - Made farms smaller and slowed down elephant movement and spawn rate.
   - Added a start button overlay so the player can get ready before the game begins.
   - Elephants now turn around and exit the screen when repelled by a deterrent.
   - Farmer resources increase very slowly in 5 point increments every 10 seconds.

5. **Bug Fixes and Iteration**
   - Fixed syntax errors and improved code structure for readability and maintainability.
   - Ensured elephants are properly removed from the game when they leave the screen.
   - Allowed the game to be restarted after game over by clicking the start button again.

6. **Current State**
   - The game is playable, with all requested features implemented.
   - The code is organized and commented for clarity.
