This game was entirely created using copilot integrated with Claude 3.5 Sonnet. It was part of a 'Vibe coding party' with conservationists in the "AI for Conservation" Slack channel.

Thanks to Prabath Gunawardane for the game concept & Dan Morris for organizing the party and pushing us to try new tools.
